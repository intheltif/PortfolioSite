# Portfolio Site

## Description
This repository is a portfolio site built for myself using React. It will
eventually be uploaded to my personal [website](evertball.com "Evert's Personal Website").

The site contains the following sections:

    * A landing page - Where the user first ends up on the website. Summary and links to important sites are here.
    * A resume page - The page that displays my resume in an organized manner.
    * An about me page - Discusses my technical background, as well as who I am as a person.
    * A contact page - Lists different methods of contacting me as well as a form that will send me an email.

## How to Run
Until this is uploaded to my personal website, the user must use `yarn start` from
inside of the `profilesite/` directory tree.

## Known Issues
There are currently no known issues. Please create an issue on Github if you feel that you have found a bug.
